<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Computer scientists and statisticians have devised numerous
mathematical criteria to define what it means for a classifier or a
model to be fair. The proliferation of these definitions represents an
attempt to make technical sense of the complex, shifting social
understanding of fairness. Thus, these definitions are laden with values
and politics, and seemingly technical discussions about mathematical
definitions in fact implicate weighty normative questions. A core
component of these technical discussions has been the discovery of
trade-offs between different (mathematical) notions of fairness; these
trade-offs deserve attention beyond the technical community.</p>
<p>This tutorial has two goals. The first is to explain the technical
definitions. In doing so, I will aim to make explicit the values
embedded in each of them. This will help policymakers and others better
understand what is truly at stake in debates about fairness criteria
(such as individual fair­ness versus group fairness, or statistical
parity versus error-rate equality). It will also help com­puter
scientists recognize that the proliferation of definitions is to be
celebrated, not shunned, and that the search for one true definition is
not a fruitful direction, as technical considerations cannot adjudicate
moral debates.</p>
<p>My second goal is to highlight technical observations and discoveries
that deserve broader con­sideration. Many of these can be seen as
“trolley problems” for algorithmic fairness, and beg to be connected to
philosophical theories of justice. I hope to make it easier for ethics
scholars, philosophers, and domain experts to approach this
territory.</p>
