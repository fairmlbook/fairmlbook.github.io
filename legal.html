<p>In this chapter, we hope to give you an appreciation of what United
States anti-discrimination law is and isn’t. We’ll use the U.S. legal
experience as a case study of how to regulate discrimination. Other
countries take different approaches. We don’t aim to describe U.S. law
comprehensively but rather give a stylized description of the key
concepts.</p>
<p>We’ll start with a history of how the major civil rights statutes
came to be, and draw lessons from this history that continue to be
relevant today. Law represents one attempt to operationalize moral
notions. It is an important and illustrative one. We will learn from the
way in which the law navigates many tricky tradeoffs. But we will also
study its limitations and use it to motivate the need to revisit the
moral foundations in the context of algorithmic fairness, rather than
seeing the goal of algorithmic fairness as legal compliance.</p>
<p>The final section addresses the specifics of regulating machine
learning. Although U.S. antidiscrimination law predates the widespread
use of machine learning, it is just as applicable if a decision maker
uses machine learning or other statistical techniques. That said,
machine learning introduces many complications to the application of
these laws, and existing law may be inadequate to address some types of
discrimination that arise when machine learning is involved. At the same
time, we believe that there is also an opportunity to exercise new
regulatory tools to rein in algorithmic discrimination.</p>

<h1>History and overview of U.S. anti-discrimination law</h1>
<p>Every inch of civil rights protections built into law was fought and
hard won through decades of activism. In this section, we briefly
describe these histories of oppression and discrimination, the movements
that arose in response to them, and the legal changes that they
accomplished.</p>
<section id="black-civil-rights" class="level2">
<h2>Black Civil Rights</h2>
<p>The Black civil rights movement, often simply called the civil rights
movement, has its roots in slavery in the United States and the rampant
racial discrimination that persisted after its abolition. The period
immediately following the American civil war and the abolition of
slavery (roughly 1865-1877) is called the Reconstruction era. It
resulted in substantial progress in civil rights. Notably, the
Constitution was amended to abolish slavery (13th amendment), require
equal protection under the laws (14th amendment), and guarantee voting
rights regardless of race (15th amendment).</p>
<p>However, these gains were rapidly undone as white supremacists gained
political control in the Southern states, ushering in the so-called Jim
Crow era, a roughly 75-year period in which the state orchestrated stark
racial segregation, discrimination, and near-total disenfranchisement of
Black people. Nearly every facet of life was racially segregated,
including residential neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, and places of
public accommodation such as restaurants and hotels. This segregation
was blessed by the Supreme Court in 1896, when it ruled that laws
mandating segregation did not violate the Equal Protection clause under
the “separate but equal”
doctrine.<span><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Plessy
v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).</span></span> But in practice, things
were far from equal. The jobs available to Black people usually paid far
less, schools were underfunded and subject to closure, and
accommodations were fewer and of inferior quality. As late as the 1950s,
a cross-country drive by a Black person would have involved great peril,
i.e., showing up at a small town at night and being refused a place to
stay.<span class="citation"

<em><span class="nocase">The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of
America’s Great Migration</span></em> (New York, NY: Penguin Random
House, 2011).</span></span></span> Black people could not democratically
challenge these laws as the states erected numerous practical barriers
to voting — ostensibly race neutral, but with vastly different effects
by race — and Black people at the polls were often met with violence. As
a result, disenfranchisement was highly effective. For example, in
Louisiana until the mid 1940s, less than 1% of African Americans were
registered to
vote.<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Keele,

Data limitations preclude a nation-wide assessment of the effectiveness
of disenfranchisement.</span></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Northern states, racial discrimination operated in
more indirect ways. Residential zoning laws that prohibited
higher-density, lower-cost housing were used to keep poorer Black
residents out of white neighborhoods. The practice of “redlining” by
banks, orchestrated to some extent by federal regulators, limited the
availability of credit, especially mortgages, in specific
neighborhoods.<span class="citation"

<em><span class="nocase">The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How
Our Government Segregated America</span></em> (New York, NY: W. W.
Norton &amp; Company, 2018).</span></span></span> The justification
proffered was the level of risk, but it had the effect of discrimination
against Black communities. Another prevalent technique to achieve
segregation was the use of racially restrictive covenants in which
property owners in a neighborhood entered into a contract not to sell or
rent to non-White
people.<span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This
practice continued until the Supreme Court struck it down in 1948
(Shelley v. Kraemer), arguing that even though these were private
contracts, if the state were to enforce them, it would violate the
constitution’s Equal Protection clause.</span></span></p>
<p>The civil rights movement emerged in the late 1800s and the early
1900s to confront these widespread practices of racism. Broadly, the
movement adopted two complementary strategies: one was to challenge
unjust laws and the other was to advance Black society within the
constraints of segregation and discrimination. A key moment in the first
prong was the formation of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People in 1909. In addition to lobbying and litigation
against Jim Crow laws, it sought to fight against lynching. Prominent
efforts under the second prong included the Black entrepreneurship
movement — 1900-1930 has been called the golden age of Black
businesses<span class="citation"

Business (New York, NY: Twayne Publishers, 1998).</span></span></span>
—and notable achievements in education. Many of the Historically Black
Colleges and Universities were founded during the Jim Crow era.</p>
<p>After decades of activism, an epochal moment was a Supreme Court
ruling in 1954 that declared the segregation of public schools
unconstitutional. This began the gradual dismantling of the Jim Crow
system, a process that would take decades and whose effects we still
feel today. The court victories further galvanized the movement, leading
to more intense activism and mass protests. This led to major federal
legislation in the following decade: the Civil Rights Act of 1960 and
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, both of which targeted voter suppression
efforts, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act of
1968 which targeted private discrimination. We will discuss the latter
two in detail throughout this chapter.</p>
<p>Antidiscrimination laws were clearly a product of history and decades
or centuries-long trends – slavery, Jim Crow, and the civil rights
movement. At the same time, their proximate causes were often specific,
unpredictable events. For example, the assassination of Martin Luther
King Jr. provided the impetus for the passage of the Fair Housing Act.
They also reflect political compromises that were necessary to secure
their passage. For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; was stripped of the
enforcement powers that had been present in the original wording of the
title.<span class="citation"

<section id="gender-discrimination" class="level2">
<h2>Gender Discrimination</h2>
<p>The struggle for gender equality also has a long and storied history
of activism. In the 1800s, the law did not recognize basic rights of
women, including voting and owning property. Changing this was the
primary goal of <em>first-wave feminists</em> whose strategies included
advocacy, civil disobedience, lobbying, and legal action. The
culminating moment was the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920,
guaranteeing women the right to
vote.<span><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Yet,
as discussed above, Black women’s right to vote was still limited in the
South.</span></span> <em>Second-wave feminism</em> began in the 1960s.
It targeted stereotypes about the role of women in society, private
discrimination in education and employment, and bodily rights, including
reproductive rights and domestic violence. In the early post-war years,
gender norms regressed in some ways (e.g., women lost access to jobs
that had been available to them because of the war) which was arguably
an impetus for the movement.<span class="citation"
data-cites="friedan"><span><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Friedan,
<em><span>The Feminine Mystique</span></em> (New York, NY: W. W. Norton
&amp; Company, 2001).</span></span></span> Two early legislative
victories were the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting employment
discrimination.<span><label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Although
the latter was primarily a response to the Black civil rights movement,
sex was added as a protected category in a last-minute
amendment.</span></span></p>
<p>However, these did not initially have much impact due to the
aforementioned lack of enforcement, and the movement only intensified.
An important milestone was the founding of the National Organization of
Women in 1965. Borrowing strategies from the Black civil rights
movement, the second-wave feminists adopted a plan to litigate in the
courts to secure protections for women. A notable court victory in the
following decade was the expansion of abortion rights by the Supreme
Court.<span><label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Roe
v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).</span></span> On the legislative front,
two major achievements for gender equality were Title IX of the
Education Amendments Act of 1972 that prohibited sex discrimination in
federally funded educational programs, and the Equal Credit Opportunity
Act that prohibited sex discrimination in credit.</p>
<p>Education, especially higher education, and credit were both
important sectors for women’s rights. Historically, many elite colleges
simply did not accept women. Even in the 1970s, women faced many
barriers in academia: sexual harassment, higher bars for admission,
outright exclusion from some high-status fields such as law and
medicine, and limited athletic opportunities. Similarly, credit
discrimination in the 1970s was also stark, such as requiring women to
reapply for credit upon marriage, usually in the husband’s
name.<span><label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Senate
report 589 of the 94th Congress</span></span> After this period, the
focus of the feminist movement expanded beyond major legislative
victories to include the questioning of gender as a social
construct.</p>

<h2>LGBTQ Civil Rights</h2>
<p>Discriminatory laws against LGBTQ people were historically numerous:
prohibition of some sexual behavior (i.e., anti-sodomy laws<span
class="citation"
data-cites="eskridge"><span><label for="sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-12" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Eskridge,
<em><span class="nocase">Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America,
1861-2003</span></em> (New York, NY: Viking, 2008).</span></span></span>
), lack of marriage rights, bans on military service and some other
government positions, a failure to prohibit private discrimination and
to treat hate crimes as such, and even a prohibition of literature
advocating for gay rights under obscenity laws.</p>
<p>Tentative activism began in the 1950s with the first legal changes
coming in the early 60s. A pivotal movement was the 1969 Stonewall
riots, a series of protests in response to a police raid at a New York
City gay bar. The aftermath of this event kickstarted the push for U.S.
LGBTQ rights, including the gay pride movement for visibility and
acceptance. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association’s
<em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> dropped
homosexuality as a disorder, signaling (and furthering) a major shift in
attitudes. The list of legal changes is long and ongoing. They include
state-by-state changes to laws involving sodomy, marriage equality,
private discrimination, and hate crimes; a 2003 Supreme Court decision
ruling anti-sodomy laws
unconstitutional;<span><label for="sn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Lawrence

LGBTQ rights in the private sector has progressed in part by
interpreting existing statutory prohibitions on sex discrimination, such
as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to encompass sexual
orientation and gender identity
discrimination.<span><label for="sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bostock

</section>
<section id="disability-laws" class="level2">
<h2>Disability Laws</h2>
<p>Another dimension of identity covered by anti-discrimination statutes
is disability. Over a quarter of adults in the United States today have
some type of disability, including mobility disabilities, blindness or
other visual disability, deafness or other hearing disability, and
cognitive disabilities.<span class="citation"
data-cites="10.15585/mmwr.mm6732a3"><span><label for="sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-16" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Okoro

role="doc-biblioref">https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6732a3</a>.</span></span></span>
These and other disabilities are distinct identities corresponding to
different lived experiences and, sometimes,
cultures.<span><label for="sn-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-17" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Notably

data-cites="DeafCulture"> (Padden and Humphries, <em><span>Inside Deaf
Culture</span></em> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press,
2006))</span></span></span> Still, the emergence of a cross-disability
coalition and identity enabled more effective advocacy for disability
rights. This movement gained steam in the decades following World War
II. Activists aimed to make disability visible, rather than stigmatized,
pitied, and hidden, and sought to achieve independent living. Like other
rights movements, disabled people faced multiple, mutually-reinforcing
barriers: society’s attitudes towards disability and disabled people,
the lack of physical accommodations and assistive technologies, and
discriminatory policies.<span class="citation"
data-cites="fleischer2013disability"><span><label for="sn-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-18" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Fleischer
and Zames, <em>The Disability Rights Movement: From Charity to
Confrontation</em> (JSTOR, 2013).</span></span></span> Attitudes that
held back disabled people weren’t just prejudice, but also mistaken
views of disability as residing in the person (the <em>medical
model</em>) instead of, or in addition to, being created by barriers in
society (the <em>social model</em>). The first federal law protecting
disability rights was the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which prohibited
disability discrimination in federally funded programs. Activism toward
a broad civil rights statute continued, with the 1964 Civil Rights Act
as a model. These efforts culminated in the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) of 1990. While the ADA has many similarities to the other
civil rights statutes, it also has major differences due to its emphasis
on accommodation in addition to formal nondiscrimination.</p>
</section>
<section id="lessons" class="level2">
<h2>Lessons</h2>
<p>The histories of the various civil rights movements hold several
lessons that continue to be relevant today. First of all, the law is a
political instrument: it can be used to discriminate, to create the
conditions under which discrimination can flourish, or to challenge
discrimnation. It can be a tool for subjugation or liberation. Laws may
be facially neutral but they are created, interpreted, and enforced by
actors that respond to the changing times and to activism. Court
decisions are also influenced by contemporary activism and even
scholarship.</p>
<p>Our brief historical discussion also helps explain why certain
sectors are regulated, and not others. Education, employment, housing,
credit, and public accommodation are domains that are both highly
salient to people’s life courses and have had histories of
discrimination that were deliberately used to subordinate some
groups.<span><label for="sn-19" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-19" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">In
addition, there are constitutional limitations on the ability of
Congress to regulate private discrimination.</span></span></p>
<p>One consequence of this sector-specific approach is that the law can
be tailored to the particularities of the sector in an attempt to avoid
loopholes. For example, the Fair Housing Act encompasses the full range
of practices related to housing including sales, rentals, advertising,
and financing. It lists (and prohibits) various ways in which housing
agents may subtly mislead or discourage clients belonging to protected
classes. Recognizing the importance of financing for securing housing,
it prohibits discrimination in financing with respect to “purchase,
construction, improvement, repair, or maintenance”. It even prohibits
ads indicating a discriminatory preference. And that includes not just
categorical statements such as “no children”, but also targeting of ads
to certain geographic regions in a way that correlates with race, and
the selection of actors used in advertising.</p>
<p>In many cases these attempts to avoid loopholes have held up well in
the face of recent technological developments. The prohibition on
discriminatory advertising has forced online ad platforms to avoid
discriminatory targeting of housing
ads.<span><label for="sn-20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-20" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">United

But this is not always so. Ride hailing platforms are able to evade
Title VII (employment discrimination) liability even though they
terminate drivers based on the (potentially discriminatory) ratings
given by passengers.<span class="citation"
data-cites="rosenblat2016discriminating"><span><label for="sn-21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-21" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Rosenblat
et al., <span>“Discriminating Tastes: Customer Ratings as Vehicles for
Bias,”</span> <em>Data &amp; Society</em>, 2016,
1–21.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Even though laws are sector-specific, it is hard to understand
discrimination by looking at any one set of institutions (such as
employment or education, much less a single organization) in isolation.
History shows us that there tend to be multiple interlocking systems of
oppression operating in tandem, such as federal housing policy and
private-sector discrimination. Similarly, the line between state and
private discrimination is not always clear.</p>
<p>History also shows that when disrupted, hierarchies tend to reassert
themselves by other means. For example, the end of de-jure segregation
accelerated the phenomenon of “White flight” from cities to the suburbs,
exacerbating de-facto segregation. Not only is progress fitful,
regression is possible. For example, Woodrow Wilson and his
administration segregated large parts of the federal workforce in the
1910s, eroding some of the gains Black people had made in previous
decades. And as we were writing this chapter, the Supreme Court reversed
<em>Roe v. Wade</em>, ending federal protection of abortion rights and
enabling severe restrictions on abortion in many states.</p>
<p>Another important point that is not apparent from the laws themselves
is that the various protected dimensions of identity have complex and
distinct histories of discrimination and activism, even if statutes
attempt to treat them all in a uniform and formal way. Even within a
single dimension like ethnicity, the oppression and struggles of
different groups take drastically different forms. Native Americans
endured a century of attempts at forced assimilation in which children
were sent to boarding schools and asked to abandon their culture. The
Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 all but eliminated the immigration of
Chinese people for over half a century and made conditions inhospitable
for the Chinese immigrant community that already existed. During World
War II, over 100,000 people of Japanese ancestry, the majority of whom
were U.S. citizens, were interned in concentration camps under the
pretense that they were disloyal to the country. These are just a few of
the more gruesome episodes of discrimination on the basis of race,
ethnicity, and national origin in U.S. history, focusing on the actions
of the government. National origin discrimination was often a thinly
veiled form of racial discrimination. Thus, although the list of
protected attributes in the law may grow over time, it is not arbitrary
and is deeply informed by
history.<span><label for="sn-22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-22" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">In
the context of equal protection doctrine, the Supreme Court has
explicitly listed the criteria that qualify a trait for protection
(“heightened scrutiny”): a history of past discrimination, political

<p>Equality under the law remains a contested and evolving notion. This
is especially the case when antidiscrimination runs up against some
countervailing value or principle, such as religious freedom or limiting
state authority. And because the law is intertwined with our lives and
livelihoods in so many ways, equality under the law, in a broad sense,
requires far more than formal nondiscrimination. Consider gender
equality. The range of legal interventions necessary to achieve it is
long and growing. Beyond voting rights and prohibition of sex and gender
discrimination, it includes prohibition of pregnancy and marital status
discrimination, curbing sexual harassment and sexual violence, abortion
rights, maternity leave laws, and childcare subsidies. Each one of these
battles has many fronts. For example, the #MeToo movement brought to
light the role of non-disparagement clauses by employers in settlements
to silence victims of workplace sexual harassment, and there is an
ongoing effort to prohibit such
clauses.<span><label for="sn-23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-23" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Senate

<p>Finally, legal change is not the end of the road but in some ways the
beginning. The effects of past discrimination tend to leave an lasting
imprint. The law itself, given political realities, can only do so much
to erase the effects of that history.</p>

<h1>A few basics of the American legal system</h1>
<p>The U.S. Constitution is the ultimate law of the land. The
constitution created the three branches of government: the legislature
(Congress), the executive (the president, executive agencies, and others
reporting to the president), and judiciary (the Supreme Court and other
courts). All three branches have important roles when it comes to
antidiscrimination law. State and local governments and laws also play
important roles in antidiscrimination, but we will say less about them
due to our pedagogical focus on federal law.</p>
<p>Before we get to the three branches, it is worth noting that the
constitution itself contains two elements relevant to discrimination
law: the right to the due process of law (fifth and fourteenth
amendments) and the right to equal protection under the laws (fourteenth
amendment). Both of these curtail the ability of the government to
discriminate. Equal protection law has also sometimes been used to
curtail private discrimination. Due process has been raised as a defense
by <em>defendants</em> of discrimination lawsuits contending that laws
that curtail their ability to discriminate violate their due process
rights.</p>
<section id="the-role-of-congress-legislative-branch" class="level2">
<h2>The role of Congress (legislative branch)</h2>
<p>Laws passed by Congress are called statutory laws, as opposed to
constitutional law, case law, and other types of law. We encountered
some of the major antidiscrimination statutes earlier. But there are
many practical and political barriers to congressional action, and
statutes or amendments are relatively rare. Thus, to stay relevant in a
changing world, laws are generally broadly worded policies and do not
attempt to anticipate the nuances of every situation in which they might
be applied. To interpret and enforce these policies, Congress delegates
authority to federal agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (established by the Civil Rights Act of 1964). The courts
also perform a vital interpretive function, as well as keeping a check
on the power of Congress itself.</p>
<p>There are three main law making powers that Congress has used to
enact antidiscrimination statutes within the limits of its
constitutional authority. The first is the Commerce Clause, which allows
Congress to regulate interstate commerce. The meaning of this clause has
been interpreted expansively by the Supreme
Court.<span><label for="sn-24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-24" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Between
1937 and 1995, a period that includes all the statutes discussed above,
not a single statute (whether or not pertaining to discrimination) was
invalidated by the Court on the ground that Congress exceeded its power

employment and credit antidiscrimination finds basis in the Commerce
Clause.<span><label for="sn-25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-25" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">When
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted, its Title II, which prohibits
discrimination in public accommodation, was famously challenged as
unconstitutional by the owner of motel in Atlanta, Georgia. The Supreme
Court upheld the constitutionality of Title II, in a case that has since
had tremendous precedential value. Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.
United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964).</span></span> The second power comes
from the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees to all citizens the
equal protection of the laws, and further empowers Congress to enforce
it through appropriate legislation. While the extent of state
involvement needed for the Fourteenth Amendment to apply is not settled,
the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act owe their
constitutional basis in part to this power. Finally, Congress has the
“power of the purse”: the ability to enact policy goals by controlling
spending, and by threatening to withhold federal funding for entities
that fail to meet certain obligations. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 and Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act of 1972 fall
under this category, which is why they only covered organizations
receiving federal funding.</p>
<p>Congress has used its power to enact antidiscrimination statutes
covering a broad swath of activities. Still, there are many gaps and
limitations in federal antidiscrimination law, in part because of
constitutional limitations and in part because Congress has failed to
act. As a result, state laws sometimes fill these gaps.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-role-of-the-courts-judicial-branch" class="level2">
<h2>The role of the courts (judicial branch)</h2>
<p>The United States adopts a common-law system, which means that courts
have the power to make law that guides decisions in future cases. This
is the concept of precedent. In disputes where the facts or principles
are similar to previous cases decided by relevant courts, judges are
bound to follow the reasoning used in the past decision (the precedent).
Similarly, courts are tasked with interpreting the statutory laws and
the Constitution. This body of precedent is referred to as case law and
can be as binding as any other law. For example, the important concept
of disparate impact, under which decision making practices may be
unlawful if they have disproportionate effects even if facially neutral
and without discriminatory intent, is the result of a Supreme Court
decision interpreting the scope of a statutory law. Most of Europe, in
contrast, adopts a civil law system which means that legislation is the
primary source of law and judicial decisions have less value as
precedent.</p>
<p>The hierarchical organization of courts determines which precedents
are binding on a particular dispute. The federal courts are organized
into three levels: the district courts at the bottom, thirteen appellate
courts (also known as circuit courts) above them, and the Supreme Court
at the top. Supreme Court decisions are binding on all lower courts and
appellate court decisions are binding on the corresponding district
courts.<span><label for="sn-26" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-26" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">All
of these are part of the federal court system. The state courts are
separate and in fact hear the great majority of cases, but the federal
courts have jurisdiction in disputes involving federal law, and are thus
of more relevance to us.</span></span> The appellate courts only hear
cases on appeal — that is, when one of the parties alleges a material
error in a district court’s decision. The Supreme Court, in turn,
usually only hears appeals of circuit court decisions. The Supreme Court
is not required to accept petitions for review; in fact, it only grants
review in a small fraction of requests.</p>
<p>When interpreting statutes, courts adopt both textual and contextual
methods. The former confines itself to the plain meaning of the statute
itself, while the latter looks to sources outside the text of the law
such as lawmakers’ originally expressed intent and the law’s purpose.
The importance of contextual factors is a contested topic and judges
differ in their approaches.</p>
<p>So far we’ve talked about the role of the courts in making law. Of
course, the primary function of the courts is to adjudicate individual
cases. So a few notes about court procedure are in order. Litigation can
be <em>civil</em> or <em>criminal</em>. Civil cases involve wrongs
against private individuals; most discrimination-related disputes fall
into this category, with a few exceptions such as hate crimes. Criminal
cases involve violations of criminal law and can only be brought by the
government.<span><label for="sn-27" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-27" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">What
makes an act a crime rather than a civil offense (other than being
legally classified as such) is a deep question. One difference is the
perceived seriousness of the wrong, deserving of retribution against the
perpetrator and not just the victim being made whole. Another is the
nature of the wronged party. Crimes can be thought of as an offense
against the state or against society, which the state has an interest in
preventing in order to avoid a breakdown of social
order.</span></span></p>
<p>A central feature of U.S. court procedure is the use of <em>adversary
proceedings</em>. The two parties to a dispute are the
<em>plaintiff</em> (who files a <em>complaint</em> alleging that they
have been wronged) and the <em>defendant</em> (who is alleged to have
committed the wrong). Both are typically represented by attorneys, who
have a lot of power in determining how the case unfolds, with the judge
having a relatively passive role as an arbiter and not an
inquisitor.</p>
<p>An example will bring together the aspects of the court system that
we’ve discussed so far. Consider the question of whether the websites of
restaurants, retailers, etc. must be accessible to visually impaired
people. The Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits excluding people
with disabilities from availing of the services of a place of public
accommodation. But does this include websites? Congress could not have
anticipated this question in 1991, so the statute (despite being
unusually detailed, running to over 20,000 words) does not address this
question directly. One set of circuit courts has looked at Congress’s
intent and purpose and found that websites themselves can be considered
places of public accommodation in keeping with the ADA’s “broad
mandate”, “sweeping purpose”, and “comprehensive character”. Another set
of circuit courts took a more textual approach, and considers it crucial
that the statute applies to the services <em>of</em> a place of public
accommodation, not services <em>in</em> a place of public accommodation.
Thus, as long as there is a sufficient “nexus” between the physical
place and the website, the accessibility requirement extends to the
website. In April 2021, one circuit court ruled differently, reading the
text of the statute to mean that only physical places can be places of
public accommodation and also rejecting the “nexus” standard adopted by
the second set of courts. When circuit courts are split in this way, it
usually takes the Supreme Court stepping in to resolve the
inconsistency, but this may take many years.</p>
<p>One reason for this state of affairs is that the Department of
Justice, which is tasked with issuing regulations to implement the ADA,
hasn’t issued a final regulation on whether websites are places of
public accommodation and, if so, what standard of accessibility they
would need to satisfy. Therefore the courts had to exercise a greater
degree of interpretive latitude than they otherwise would. It also gave
rise to a concern in some courts that imposing accessibility
requirements without setting a clear standard would deprive defendants
of their constitutional right to due process. This highlights the
importance of executive departments and federal agencies, to which we
will turn next.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-role-of-the-federal-agencies-executive-branch"
class="level2">
<h2>The role of the federal agencies (executive branch)</h2>
<p>The main anti-discrimination functions of the federal agencies are
rulemaking, guidance, and law enforcement. For example, the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act broadly makes credit discrimination unlawful, but leaves
it to the Federal Reserve to draft and interpret regulations that
implement this mandate (Congress later transferred this authority to the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau). This process is called
<em>rulemaking</em>. The resulting regulations constitute
<em>administrative law</em> and have the force of law alongside
statutory law and case law.</p>
<p>Rules differ slightly from guidelines. A group of agencies led by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued the <em>Uniform
Guidelines for Employee Selection Procedures</em> in 1978 that spell out
a framework for ensuring that tests and other employee selection
procedures are compliant with VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The
Uniform Guidelines are widely relied upon by employers. But the Uniform
Guidelines do not constitute law. They are often referenced in court
opinions, and courts generally give significant deference to agency
guidelines, but courts are not bound by them.</p>
<p>It’s hard to overstate the practical importance of the agencies.
Whether or not a statute has real teeth depends in large part on the
implementing agency. The EEOC initially refused to take up gender
discrimination despite being empowered to do so. In fact, Title VII had
no teeth for even racial discrimination until amended in 1972 to empower
the EEOC to take action (the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of
1972).<span class="citation"

<p>Agencies differ in their level of political independence; some are
housed within the executive (such as the Department of Housing and Urban
Development and the Department of Labor) while others are more
independent (such as the EEOC and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)).
The latter have enforcement powers in addition to rulemaking powers.
They can conduct investigations and file suit in court; some even have
their own judicial systems and are sometimes called a de facto fourth
branch of government. In short, interpreting as well as enforcing the
statutes are both tasks shared by the federal agencies and the courts.
They generally work harmoniously
together,<span><label for="sn-29" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-29" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">However,
this has been changing since the Trump administration. <span

Policy</em> 16, no. 1 (2018): 103–22)</span></span></span> but the
proliferation of sources of law and methods of enforcement can lead to
inefficiency and confusion.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning two other important sources of policy:
executive orders and rules internal to institutions. Executive orders
are directives issued by the president of the United States. Originally
intended as a way to manage the affairs of the government, the vast
reach of the federal government has meant that they are a powerful
de-facto for enacting policy. For example, precursors to Title VII in
the form of executive orders go as far back as
1941.<span><label for="sn-30" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-30" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Executive
Order No. 8802, 6 Federal Register 3109 (June 25, 1941).</span></span>
Although much weaker in scope than the eventual legislation, they
illustrate the ability of presidents to act quickly while Congress might
be stalled.</p>
<p>Institutions, whether public or private, may set non-discrimination
rules or guidelines for their employees that may go beyond the
requirements of the law. For example, asking a job candidate about their
marital status is not per-se unlawful. However, it would be construed as
evidence of intent to discriminate in a legal dispute.<span

Considering this (and the fact that there is almost never a job-related
reason for such an inquiry), many organizations prohibit their
interviewers from asking such questions. On a day-to-day basis, these
institutional guidelines are the most direct nondiscrimination rules
that individuals are bound by.</p>
</section>
<section id="case-study-the-evolution-of-title-ix" class="level2">
<h2>Case study: the evolution of Title IX</h2>
<p>Title IX of the educational amendments act of 1972 prohibits sex
discrimination in educational institutions that receive federal funds.
In 1975, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) published
the final regulations detailing how Title IX would be enforced. Since
1975, the federal government has issued guidance clarifying how it
interprets and enforces those regulations.</p>
<p>Two of the big questions surrounding Title IX were what constitutes
receiving federal financial assistance and what constitutes sex
discrimination. Each of these had the potential to vastly impact the
reach of the law. In 1984, the Supreme Court ruled that Title IX was
program specific: that is, only those programs and activities receiving
direct federal funds needed to comply. This gutted the application of
Title IX: for example, most athletic programs were no longer covered
since they didn’t directly receive federal funds. In response, Congress
drafted a bill specifically intended to overturn this decision,
restoring the broad scope of Title IX, which it retains to this
day.<span><label for="sn-32" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-32" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><span

Incidentally, the institution at the center of this controversy was
Grove City college, a conservative Christian college which did not
directly accept any federal money in an attempt to retain its autonomy.
After 1988, it would have been covered under Title IX because its
students were recipients of federal loans and grants, illustrating the
broad reach of the state. To this day, the college escapes Title IX
responsibilities by prohibiting its students from receiving any federal
student loans or grants (such as Pell grants).</span></span></p>
<p>Two other major disputes regarding the scope of Title IX are whether
schools are responsible for sexual harassment that happens on campuses
and whether discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender
identity is prohibited. Unlike the coverage question, these continue to
be the topic of vociferous legal and political debate. On the sexual
harassment front, the Supreme Court held that in the late ’90s that
schools are responsible for creating a safe environment, including
preventing harassment by other students, but “the student must show that
an official of the school with authority to respond actually knew of and
was deliberately indifferent to the harassment”. The Obama, Trump, and
Biden administrations have all introduced guidelines or regulations on
this question, in turn expanding and contracting the scope of Title
IX.<span class="citation"

<section id="how-the-law-conceives-of-discrimination" class="level1">
<h1>How the law conceives of discrimination</h1>
<p>There are many possible ways to define discrimination and attempt to
achieve nondiscrimination. In this section, we will discuss how the law
conceives of discrimination and how it tries to balance
nondiscrimination with other ideals.</p>
<section id="disparate-treatment-and-disparate-impact" class="level2">
<h2>Disparate treatment and disparate impact</h2>
<p>Imagine an employer turning down a job candidate and explicitly
informing them that this decision was on account of a protected
characteristic. Such a case would be relatively straightforward to
adjudicate based on the text of the statute itself (“It shall be an
unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire
an individual… because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex,
or national origin.”) However, in most cases of discrimination, the
decision maker’s behavior is less explicit and the evidence is more
circumstantial. To deal with these, courts have created two main
doctrines called disparate treatment and disparate impact.</p>
<p>Disparate treatment refers to intentional discrimination and roughly
matches the average person’s conception of discriminatory behavior. It
subsumes the straightforward case described in the previous paragraph.
For more circumstantial cases, the Supreme Court has established a
so-called burden shifting framework under Title VII (employment law).
First, the plaintiff must establish a “prima facie” case of
discrimination by showing that they are a member of a protected class,
was qualified for a position, was denied it, and the position then
remained open or was given to someone not in the protected class. If the
plaintiff is successful at this, the employer must produce a legitimate,
non-discriminatory reason for the adverse decision. The plaintiff then
has the burden of proving that the proffered reason is merely a pretext
for
discrimination.<span><label for="sn-35" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-35" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">More
precisely, this is only one of the possible frameworks; we describe it
for illustrative purposes. The full picture—including the game of which
framework to choose—is a vast morass; see e.g. Katz, Martin J. “Unifying
Disparate Treatment (Really).” Hastings Law Journal 59, no. 3 (2008):
643–82.</span></span></p>
<p>Disparate treatment usually involves reasoning about what action the
defendant would have taken if the plaintiff’s protected characteristic
had been different, with all other facts of the case unchanged.
Elsewhere in this book we argue why, from a technical perspective, these
“attribute-flipping” counterfactuals are at odds with a nuanced
understanding of causality and result in brittle tests for
discrimination. In any event, the importance of causality in disparate
treatment, especially so-called but-for causation, has increased
following a 2020 Supreme Court
decision<span><label for="sn-36" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-36" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Bostock
v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. ___ (2020)</span></span> which held that it
is impossible to engage in sexual orientation discrimination without
engaging in sex discrimination by imagining a counterfactual in which
the victim’s sex is changed without affecting anything else, including
gender preference. While celebrated from a civil rights perspective
because of its implications for LGBTQ rights, we should keep in mind
that this represents a narrow understanding of causality and its
application in other scenarios may yield conclusions not so favorable to
civil rights.</p>
<p>In contrast to disparate treatment, disparate impact is about
practices that have a disproportionate effect on a protected class, even
if unintentional. At a high level, disparate impact must be both
unjustified and avoidable. This is again operationalized through a
burden-shifting framework. First, the plaintiff must establish that
there is a disproportionate difference in selection rates between
different groups. If that can be shown, then the employer has the
opportunity to explain if the reason for the different selection rates
has a business justification. The burden then reverts to the plaintiff
to show that there is an “alternative employment practice” that would
have achieved the employer’s aims while being less discriminatory.</p>
<p>One way to think about disparate impact is as a way to “sniff out”
well-concealed intentional discrimination by putting the focus on its
impacts, which are more readily observable. Indeed, the case that led to
the doctrine involved an employer that introduced aptitude tests for
promotion on the very day that the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that
prohibited employment discrimination based on race, took effect.<span
class="citation"
data-cites="GriggsPrice"><span><label for="sn-37" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-37" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Price,

under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</span>,”</span>
<em>Southwestern Law Journal</em> 25, no. 3 (2016):
484–93.</span></span></span></p>
<p>But disparate impact is also thought to be motivated by a
consideration of distributive justice, that is, minimizing unjustified
inequalities in outcomes. In this sense, disparate impact roughly
corresponds to the ``middle view’’ of equality of opportunity that we
discussed in Chapter 4. Disparate impact tries to force decision-makers
to treat seemingly dissimilar people similarly on the belief that their
current dissimilarity is a result of past injustice. It aims to
compensate for at least some of the disadvantagesuffered for unjust
reasons. Indeed, in the case mentioned above, the Supreme Court pointed
out that the racial performance disparity on aptitude tests could be
explained by inequalities in the educational system. But disparate
impact doctrine has evolved over the years and the extent to which it
reflects distributive justice, as opposed to a device for illuminating
well-concealed discrimination, is thought to have waned over time.</p>
<p>While we have discussed these two doctrines in the context of
employment law, they are found in each of the six domains we discussed
in the first section. Disparate impact has been so central to the legal
understanding of discrimination that it was later incorporated into
statutes, notably the ADA (disability law), but also into Title VII
(equal employment law) itself through a 1991 amendment. But the Supreme
Court has not extended the doctrine to situations where the laws or
procedures of the state (rather than private actors) violate the Equal
Protection Clause if they have a discriminatory purpose. In other words,
there is no equivalent of disparate impact doctrine for state actors,
only disparate treatment.</p>
<p>An important general observation about antidiscrimination
law—especially for readers who may be accustomed to thinking about
fairness in terms of the statistical properties of the outputs of
decision making processes—is that the law is primarily concerned with
the processes themselves. Relatedly, the way that courts go about
weighing evidence is also highly procedural, to the point where it may
seem tangential to the substantive question of whether discrimination
took place.<span class="citation"

<p>There are many possible reasons for the law’s focus on process. One
is historical: the statutes were primarily responding to blunt
discrimination and formal denials of opportunity as opposed to more
subtle statistical phenomena. It is also a better match for how the law
works: the definition of discrimination cannot be divorced from the
procedure for proving it in court. A third reason is political: it is
easier to achieve consensus about fair processes than what the right
distributive outcome is. Finally, at a pragmatic level, it reflects the
law’s attention to the nuances of workplaces and other institutions,
compared to which statistical fairness criteria seem crude and
oversimplified.</p>

<h2>Avoiding excessiveburdens on decision makers</h2>
<p>A recurring theme is how much burden on decision makers is justified
in pursuit of fairness goals. For example, making accommodations for
disabled employees results in some cost to a firm.</p>
<p>In general, the law gives substantial deference to the interests of
the decision maker. This has been repeatedly made clear by lawmakers and
the courts at various points in time. For example, the House Judiciary
Committee said on the role of the EEOC at the moment of the agency’s
inception: “management prerogatives, and union freedoms are to be left
undisturbed to the greatest extent
possible.”<span><label for="sn-40" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-40" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">H.R.
no 914 Pt 2, 88th Cong. 1st Session 29, 1963.</span></span> The Supreme
Court clarified in 2015 that “The FHA (Fair Housing Act) is not an
instrument to force housing authorities to reorder their
priorities.”<span><label for="sn-41" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-41" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Texas
Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project,
Inc., 576 U.S. 519 (2015.</span></span></p>
<p>One exception is the Americans with Disabilities Act which imposes
substantial compliance requirements on a large set of firms and
governments. This shouldn’t be a surprise since the law sought to create
structural changes in society, especially to the built environment. The
ADA does have an “undue hardship” defense to the requirement that
employers provide “reasonable accommodations” to qualified employees
with disabilities, but courts appear to tolerate a higher burden than
under, say, Title
VII.<span><label for="sn-42" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-42" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The
ADA originally called for a higher bar: an accommodation would have to
threaten the continued existence of the employer’s business. <span
class="citation" data-cites="porter2019new"> (Porter, <span>“A New Look
at the ADA’s Undue Hardship Defense,”</span> <em>Mo. L. Rev.</em> 84
(2019): 121)</span> In fact, the part of the law that applies to public
services does have a higher bar for the defendant: the accommodation
must fundamentally alter the nature of the service or
program.</span></span> As an illustration, blind employees sued their
employers for failing to provide paid readers for four hours of the
workday; the court sided with the plaintiffs, implying that a roughly
50% increase in the cost of the employees to the employer did not
constitute an undue hardship.<span class="citation"
data-cites="porter2019new"><span><label for="sn-43" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-43" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Porter.</span></span></span>
We hasten to add that undue hardship is a multi-factor test and there is
no clear or uniform cost threshold; cost is rarely the determinative
factor.</p>
<p>There are a range of potential justifications of the burdens on
decision makers in the academic scholarship and legislative history.
Often the responsibilities of decision makers are justified by appeal to
the human rights of those being harmed, rather than an economic
analysis. For example, the ADA sought to intervene in discrimination
against disabled people that often affected their livelihoods and
sometimes cost lives.<span class="citation"
data-cites="porter2019new"><span><label for="sn-44" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-44" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Porter.</span></span></span>
Alternatively, burdens are sometimes justified because they pose only a
“de minimis” cost. For example, Title VII requires employers to make
accommodations for employees’ religious beliefs, but not if it would
pose more than a minimal cost.</p>
<p>In between these two types of cases lie a variety of others where a
more careful balance between benefits and costs is
necessary.<span><label for="sn-45" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-45" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">These
types of questions are studied in the field of law and economics, which

laws.</span></span> We give a few brief examples here.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Positive externality</em>. A hope behind the Americans with
Disabilities Act was that it would make it easier for disabled people to
enter the workforce and contribute to the overall
economy.<span><label for="sn-46" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-46" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">In
fact, the fraction of disabled individuals employed has decreased since
the passage of the ADA, although the causal effect is far from
clear.</span></span></li>
<li><em>Regulation as collective action</em>. Title II of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in places of public
accommodation (e.g., restaurants). A major reason why such
establishments discriminated against minorities is due to the prejudices
of their white customers. Title II enabled them to stop discriminating,
gaining business from minority customers without incurring lost business
from their white customers ; thus, the law did not impose a burden on
them but rather created an opportunity.<span class="citation"

Similarly, consider insurance. In the absence of regulation, if an
insurer avoids calibrating premiums to risk in the interest of fairness,
it might go out of business. But if all firms in the market have their
behavior constrained by antidiscrimination law in the same way, they can
no longer claim to be at a competitive disadvantage.</li>
<li><em>Cheapest cost avoider</em>. The cheapest cost avoider or least
cost avoider principle assigns liability from a harm to the party that
can avoid the harm at the lowest cost. It is the reason why firms, to
some extent, bear liability for discrimination or harassment committed
by their employees. If an employer is forced to internalize the costs of
discriminatory harassment committed by its employees, it will, on
standard economic theory, invest in precautions up to the point where
they are no longer cost justified.<span class="citation"

<h1>Limits of the law in curbing discrimination</h1>
<p>How effective has United States antidiscrimination law been? The
best-case scenario is that the possibility of penalties has sufficiently
deterred would-be discriminators that rates of discrimination have
plummeted, and, in the few remaining cases of discrimination, victims
manage to obtain redress through the courts. The worst-case scenario is
that the laws have had virtually no effect, and any reductions in
disparities since their passage can be attributed to other factors such
as discriminators being less successful in the market.</p>
<p>The reality is somewhere in between. Rigorously evaluating the effect
of laws is a tricky counterfactual problem and is subject to much
uncertainty and debate. However, there is much evidence suggestive of a
positive effect. For example, one study used a natural experiment to
evaluate the impact of Title VII on job opportunities for African
Americans relative to White Americans. It showed that the relative
employment of African Americans increased more in industries and regions
with a greater proportion of firms that were newly covered under Title
VII by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972.<span

<p>While the gains have been non-negligible, the effectiveness of
anti-discrimination law is blunted for many reasons which we now
discuss. This motivates our view that work on algorithmic fairness
should not treat the approach adopted in antidiscrimination law as a
given , but should instead reconnect with the moral foundations of
fairness.</p>
<section id="burdens-on-victims-of-discrimination" class="level2">
<h2>Burdens on victims of discrimination</h2>
<p>The law places an array of burdens on victims of discrimination if
they wish to seek legal recourse. We will use the labor market as our
running example, but our observations apply to other contexts as
well.</p>
<p>To begin with, legal intervention is initiated by the victim, not the
government,<span><label for="sn-51" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-51" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">There
are limited exceptions to this general principle, such as the ability of
enforcement agencies to bring “pattern-or-practice” cases against repeat
discriminators. A recent prominent example is the Department of Justice
settlement against the Pennsylvania Police Deptartment. U.S. v.
Pennsylvania &amp; Pennsylvania State Police, no.1:14-cv-01474-SHR
(M.D. Pa. July 29, 2014), <a
href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2014/07/31/pennsylvaniapdcomp.pdf">https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2014/07/31/pennsylvaniapdcomp.pdf</a>.</span></span>
and cannot begin until after victims have already suffered
discrimination. Regulators do not prospectively review employment
practices, in contrast to other areas of law such as pharmaceutical
regulation where drugs must be thoroughly tested before being allowed on
the market. Further, there is a fundamental information asymmetry
between firms and employees (or job candidates). Victims may not even be
aware that they have faced discrimination. After all, job candidates and
employees have no direct visibility into employers’ decision making
process and firms need not provide a justification for an adverse hiring
or promotion decision. Only in the domain of credit does some form of
transparency requirement
exist.<span><label for="sn-52" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-52" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">However,
the turn to algorithmic tools in hiring has opened the possibility of
transparency requirements and ex-ante review. A coalition of civil
rights organizations have advocated for such practices in a document
laying out a set of civil rights principles for hiring assessment
technologies. <a
href="http://civilrightsdocs.info/pdf/policy/letters/2020/Hiring_Principles_FINAL_7.29.20.pdf">http://civilrightsdocs.info/pdf/policy/letters/2020/Hiring_Principles_FINAL_7.29.20.pdf</a>
We discuss emerging ideas such as Algorithmic Impact Assessments in the
final section of this chapter.</span></span></p>
<p>Even if a victim becomes aware of discrimination, they face barriers
that may deter them from suing. Litigation involves additional mental
anguish. Victims may also be deterred by the high financial costs of
litigation.<span><label for="sn-53" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-53" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This
can be mitigated in some cases if law firms are willing to be paid on a
contingency fee basis—wherein they are paid only in the event of a
favorable result as a fixed percentage of the damages recovered—or if
the statute provides for collective or class actions.</span></span>
Lawsuits typically take several years to reach a conclusion, by which
time the victim’s career may suffer a significant and irreparable
setback. If the victim remains at the firm after filing suit, they face
an uncomfortable situation in the best case, and potentially retaliation
from the employer (even though laws specifically prohibit retaliation,
it remains a common result of discrimination lawsuits). And if the
victim seeks employment elsewhere, future employers may weigh negatively
the fact that the candidate sued a previous employer for
discrimination.</p>
<p>Victims who decide to sue face a battery of procedural hurdles. If
the employer has internal grievance procedures, the victim may be
required to try those before suing (or risk losing her claims). Another
prerequisite to filing suit is to file an administrative complaint with
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission promptly after the
discrimination starts. The timeliness requirement often puts victims in
a double bind because of the need to exhaust internal channels. It also
makes it difficult to collect the evidence necessary to prevail in
court.<span class="citation"

<p>That brings us to the final and most serious difficulty that
plaintiffs face, which is the burden of proof. To be sure, the standard
of proof that the plaintiff must meet in discrimination cases is
“preponderance of the evidence”, which means more likely than not, which
is lower than the standard in criminal cases. But even this standard has
proved daunting. According to Eyer, “anti-discrimination law is a highly
rigid technical area of the law, in which any of a myriad of technical
doctrines can lead to dismissal. Courts approach the question of
discrimination as if it were a complex legal puzzle, in which any piece
out of place must result in the dismissal of the plaintiffs’
claims.”<span class="citation"

<span>“The but-for Theory of Anti-Discrimination
Law.”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Specifically, in disparate treatment cases, courts have created
numerous defendant-friendly doctrines. Under the “stray remarks”
doctrine, discriminatory comments made by the employer about the
plaintiff do not constitute evidence of discriminatory intent unless
there is a sufficiently clear causal nexus to the decision itself. Under
the “same actor” defense, if the employer was willing to hire the
plaintiff at a previous time, it is taken as evidence that the employer
bears no discriminatory intent against the plaintiff. Under the “honest
belief” rule, a case can be summarily dismissed if the employer
“honestly believed” in the reasons for the decision, even if they can
later be shown to be “mistaken, foolish, trivial, or baseless.”</p>
<p>In disparate impact, an overlapping set of factors is arrayed against
the plaintiff. While there is no need to establish intent, there is a
new set of requirements: identifying a specific policy or practice that
caused the adverse employment decision; compiling the requisite
statistics to show that the policy has a disparate impact; and rebutting
the employer’s defense that the policy is justified by job-relatedness.
The third prong is a particularly severe hurdle for plaintiffs as they
are structurally poorly positioned to identify an alternative employment
practice, lacking the knowledge of the internals of the business that
the employer does.<span class="citation"

<p>The net result of these barriers to plaintiffs is that their odds of
success at trial are exceedingly low. Katie Eyer summarizes data from
the Uncertain Justice project: “of every 100 discrimination plaintiffs
who litigate their claims to conclusion (i.e., do not settle or
voluntarily dismiss their claims), only 4 achieve any form (de minimis
or not) of relief. … These odds can properly be characterized as
shockingly bad, and extend (with minor differences) to every category of
discrimination plaintiff, including race, sex, age, and
disability.”<span class="citation"

<p>We should note that there is a widespread view that employment
discrimination lawsuits are too <em>easy</em> to file and too favorable
to plaintiffs, a position we reject. Selmi critically examines this
perception and notes that it is prevalent among judges; correcting this
perceived imbalance may in fact be one reason for the creation of

class="level2">
<h2>The difficulty of substantive and structural reform through
procedural intervention</h2>
<p>Even if compliance with antidiscrimination law is high, and legal
remedies are readily attained, there may be even more fundamental limits
to the effectiveness of the law. To what extent do the formal limits
that the law imposes on individuals and organizations lead to a just
society? How big is the gap between legal and moral notions of
unfairness?</p>
<p>Legal scholar Stephen C. Halpern frames the issue thus:<span
class="citation"
data-cites="HalpernIronic"><span><label for="sn-60" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-60" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Halpern,
<em><span class="nocase">On the Limits of the Law: The Ironic Legacy of
Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act</span></em> (Baltimore, MD: Johns
Hopkins University Press, 1995).</span></span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In translating a social problem into the “language” of the law,
lawyers must frame their analysis in terms of contrived concepts,
issues, questions, and remedies that the legal system recognizes and
deems legitimate. In that translation, as in any translation, there are
constrictions and distortions. Framing a social problem as a legal issue
produces a transformation of the issue itself—a reconceptualization of
the problem, yielding unique questions and concerns that first become
the focus of the legal debate and subsequently tend to dominate public
discussion. When racial problems are reformulated as questions of legal
rights, the resulting dialogue does not capture the complexity and
subtlety of those problems or permit consideration of the fullest range
of remedies for them. Inevitably, the demands and limits of the legal
process alter the public discourse about and understanding of vital
racial issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Halpern’s book is about racial inequality in education; his main
example of his thesis is the effort that was put into ending segregation
of public schools without much attention paid to the quality of
education received by Black students in integrated schools. Similarly,
Title VI litigation focused on procedures for processing complaints of
discrimination filed with the federal government, rather than mechanisms
to vindicate substantive rights to an education of comparable quality.
He argues that “[f]ew, if any, of the factors that have an impact on
educational achievement are governed by “legal rights” or are readily
translatable into an issue of “racial discrimination”.” He gives two
reasons why inequalities persist despite the law’s formal remedies: the
de-facto segregation of American cities and the fact that academic
differences often arise from instability in the home and other social,
economic, and health disparities.</p>
<p>While the effect of school desegregation in the United States is a
vast topic, the broader point is that limitations of the legal process
restrict what is achievable—and even shape our understanding of the
issues themselves. Another example of this comes from the book <em>Color
of Law</em>:<span class="citation"
data-cites="coloroflaw"><span><label for="sn-61" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-61" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Rothstein,
<em><span class="nocase">The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How
Our Government Segregated America</span></em>.</span></span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although most African Americans have suffered under [historically
racist government housing policies], they cannot identify, with the
specificity a court case requires, the particular point at which they
were victimized. For example, many African American World War II
veterans did not apply for government guaranteed mortgages for suburban
purchases because they knew that the Veterans Administration would
reject them on account of their race, so applications were pointless.
Those veterans then did not gain wealth from home equity appreciation as
did white veterans, and their descendants could not then inherit that
wealth as did white veterans’ descendants. With less inherited wealth,
African Americans today are generally less able than their white peers
to afford to attend good colleges. If one of those African American
descendants now learned that the reason his or her grandparents were
forced to rent apartments in overcrowded urban areas was that the
federal government unconstitutionally and unlawfully prohibited banks
from lending to African Americans, the grandchild would not have the
standing to file a lawsuit; nor would he or she be able to name a
particular party from home damages could be recovered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another impetus toward proceduralism comes from the interaction of
the court system with the internal procedures of organizations. Under
the theory of legal endogeneity, organizations enact procedural
protections, such as diversity training programs, with the putative aim
of curbing discrimination; over time, courts gradually come to mistake
these procedural and symbolic compliance-oriented activities for
substantive measures; but once these symbolic measures themselves attain
legal significance, substantive concerns have been pushed outside the
scope of legitimate debate.<span class="citation"

<p>Further, even substantive change at individual organizations may not
imply structural change—that is, a change to the underlying factors in
society that produce disparities in the first place. Even if an employer
achieved statistical parity in hiring and promotion rates, the
application rates might themselves reflect unequal opportunity in
society and/or discrimination at previous levels or stages of the
system, and there is little the law can do to compel individual decision
makers to remedy these inequalitites.</p>
<p>Legal interventions whose effects are both substantive and structural
are rare. One notable example is the impact of Title IX on women’s
athletics. The law has been interpreted to not only prohibit
discrimination in a narrow sense but also require equity in a number of
areas such as scholarships, coaching, and facilities. Arguably as a
result of these interventions, women’s athletics in the United States
has gradually risen in prestige, weakening the gender hierarchy in
athletics, leading to greater parity in athletics even outside the
collegiate
context.<span><label for="sn-63" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-63" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This
is not to say that fairness has been achieved in women’s athletics or
athletic programs in general: horrific sexual abuse scandals remind us
that there is a long way to go.</span></span> In general, however, these
types of substantive interventions have so far proved less feasible than
formal ones in part because of the funding they require.</p>
<p>Although we have contrasted procedural interventions with substantive
and structural interventions above, the line between them can be murky,
and the former can at least function as a toehold to the latter. To the
extent that inequality persists because of entrenched policies that
maintain an unequal distribution of resources, procedural interventions
that allow members of historically oppressed groups to rise to positions
of authority might allow them to more effectively alter these policies.
Procedural interventions can help reduce the capacity of already
advantaged groups from usurping full control over the policy-making
process. Still, this is far from an ideal route to change, as it places
the burden of advancing the interests of specific groups on individuals
who belong to those groups.</p>
<p>Another seeming contrast is between discrimination law and
redistributive policies, i.e., the government directly taxing certain
actors and reallocating those funds to the disadvantaged group. But
discrimination law can be understood to be a mechanism that places the
economic burden of rectifying past injustice to some extent on
employers, lenders, etc. In some ways, this might be similar to a policy
of taxing employers and using those funds to support groups that have
been subject to discrimination in the past.</p>
<p>Affirmative action policies, in particular, occupy a space that is
squarely in between formal nondiscrimination and redistributive
policies. An example of such a policy would be a job training program
offered by an employer that favored groups with lower access to
opportunities.<span><label for="sn-64" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-64" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">United
Steelworkers of America v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979).</span></span>
However, except in rare cases, the law does not <em>compel</em>
affirmative action by private entities but merely <em>allows</em> it.
More commonly seen are affirmative requirements for governments. The
Fair Housing Act, in addition to nondiscrimination mandates, requires
HUD and recipients of federal funds from HUD to “affirmatively further”
the policies and purposes of the act. This might enable, for instance,
subsidized housing in high-income communities that opens up access to
higher-quality schools and amenities. However, this part of the FHA has
largely lain dormant. Thus, at least some of the limitation of the law
in creating meaningful change can be attributed to the lack of political
will to fully act upon existing laws, rather than an inherent limitation
of the legal system.</p>

<section id="regulating-machine-learning" class="level1">
<h1>Regulating machine learning</h1>
<p>Although U.S. antidiscrimination law predates the widespread use of
machine learning, it is just as applicable if a decision maker uses
machine learning or other statistical techniques. That said, machine
learning introduces many complications to the application of these laws.
These complications are being vigorously debated in the legal
scholarship, and many scholars are concerned that existing law may be
inadequate to address the types of discrimination that arise when
machine learning is involved. At the same time, there is also an
opportunity to exercise new regulatory tools to rein in algorithmic
discrimination. There is little case law on this topic, so our
discussion of these issues will be based on legal scholarship. As
before, our discussion is U.S.-centric but we touch upon the EU’s
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in a few places.</p>
<section id="disparate-treatment" class="level2">
<h2>Disparate treatment</h2>
<p>Recall that the two main anti-discrimination doctrines are disparate
treatment and disparate impact. Disparate treatment is principally
concerned with the explicit intent to discriminate on the basis of
legally protected characteristics; in contrast, disparate impact focuses
on decision-making where there is no explicit intent to discriminate,
but where even decisions made on the basis of seemingly benign
characteristics nevertheless results in unjustified disparities along
characteristics that are legally protected.</p>
<p>Most reports of discrimination in machine learning have been cases of
unintentional rather than intentional discrimination. Besides,
developers of machine learning systems who intend to discriminate are
unlikely to rely explicitly on protected attributes due to the easy
availability of proxies. When this happens, it can be hard to prove that
there was an intent to mask discrimination. For these reasons, disparate
treatment is rarely invoked and disparate impact is seen as much more
relevant. We will return to disparate impact shortly. But one important
question involving disparate treatment relates to systems that
explicitly rely on the protected attribute to correct data biases or
mitigate the effects of past discrimination. Does this constitute
disparate treatment? In other words, does law impose limits on
algorithmic fairness interventions?</p>
<p>The answer is nuanced. One relatively bright line in the law is that
selection quotas are unconstitutional. In machine learning terms, this
roughly maps to the difference between techniques that aim to enforce
parity and those that merely penalize disparity during the optimization
step. The latter type of technique is analogous to a process that is
race conscious and values diversity but still allows the final
distribution to vary depending on the set of candidates. It is helpful,
as always, to remember that technical distinctions rarely map cleanly to
legal determinations.</p>
<p>There is also a major difference between an individual decision made
on the basis of a protected attribute and an overall policy that takes
the interests of protected groups into account. Disparate treatment
primarily applies to the former type of decision. This is similar to the
distinction between the use of a protected attribute at training versus
test time, although, again, this distinction by itself is far from
legally determinative.</p>
<p>A Supreme Court case that is often cited as an example of the tension
between disparate treatment and disparate impact (and the
disparate-treatment pitfalls of race-conscious decision making) is Ricci
v. DeStefano. The case arose because the New Haven fire department
scrapped a promotional exam after finding that Black firefighters had a
lower passage rate than White firefighters. The department worried that
it would open itself to disparate impact liability. But it was then sued
by the White and Hispanic firefighters who would have qualified for
promotion based on the exam. The court agreed with the plaintiffs that
the department had engaged in disparate treatment against them.</p>
<p>Pauline Kim notes a crucial distinguishing feature of the Ricci case:
the plaintiffs had already invested considerable time and expense in
studying for the exam, and thus the department’s actions resulted in
concrete harm to specific individuals. In Kim’s view, the court’s logic
wouldn’t apply when an employer <em>prospectively</em> makes a change to
its hiring practices in order to avoid the potential for disparate
impact.<span class="citation"

<span>“<span class="nocase">Race-Aware Algorithms: Fairness,
Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action</span>,”</span> <em>California
Law Review</em>, 2022.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Finally, even if a practice constitutes prima-facie disparate
treatment, it may be legal if it is part of a valid affirmative action
program, i.e., one that aims to remedy past discrimination. In
employment, the Supreme Court has ruled that race- or gender-based
affirmative action programs are valid if they seek to eliminate
“manifest imbalances” in “traditionally segregated job categories” and
do not “unnecessarily trammel” the interests of other candidates. Some
scholars have argued that this should hold for voluntary algorithmic
affirmative action as well.<span class="citation"

<section id="disparate-impact" class="level2">
<h2>Disparate impact</h2>
<p>To understand how disparate impact applies to statistical decision
making, we must unpack the legal doctrine. The burden-shifting framework
established by the Supreme Court for Title VII employment discrimination
claims works as
follows.<span><label for="sn-67" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-67" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Griggs
v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971)</span></span> First, the
plaintiff must establish a prima-facie case by showing a sufficient
difference in selection rates between different groups. What constitutes
a sufficient difference is unclear. The EEOC has established a threshold
of four-fifths (i.e. a difference of 20%) as a guideline, but this is
not a strict rule. In a big-data world, some commentators have argued
that the criterion should be based on statistical significance of the
difference rather than the
magnitude.<span><label for="sn-68" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-68" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">In
fact, statistical significance has always been a part of the EEOC
criteria alongside substantive significance.</span></span></p>
<p>If the plaintiff is successful at showing a sufficient difference,
burden shifts to the defendant, who must then establish that the
challenged practice is “job related” and consistent with “business
necessity”. If the defendant can show this, then the plaintiff can still
win by showing that there is an “alternative employment practice” that
would have achieved the employer’s aims while being less
discriminatory.</p>
<p>The critical step from the perspective of statistical decision making
is the question of business necessity. One way the employer can show
this is through “empirical data demonstrating that the selection
procedure is predictive of or significantly correlated with important
elements of job performance.” Since machine learning is a technique for
establishing predictive validity, commentators such as Barocas and
Selbst suggest that this represents an exceedingly low bar for
employers.<span class="citation"
data-cites="barocas2016big"><span><label for="sn-69" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-69" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Barocas
and Selbst, <span>“Big Data’s Disparate Impact,”</span> <em><span>UCLA
Law Review</span></em>, 2016.</span></span></span> As long as the target
variable used in a predictive model is putatively job-related, the
requirement is satisfied.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Pauline Kim argues that Title VII can in fact
effectively address discriminatory effects of machine learning, based on
a close reading of the statute.<span class="citation"
data-cites="kim2017data"><span><label for="sn-70" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-70" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Kim,
<span>“<span class="nocase">Data-Driven Discrimination at
Work</span>,”</span> <em>William &amp; Mary Law Review</em> 58, no. 3
(2017): 857–936.</span></span></span> However, the doctrine that has
developed since its passage is a poor fit for addressing discriminatory
machine learning. For example, the requirement for the plaintiff to
identify a specific employment practice that caused the disparity
developed in an era when written tests were the primary vehicle for
disparate impact. But when a statistical model is at play, especially an
uninterpretable one that uses a large number of features, it is not
clear what the plaintiff is supposed to identify. Thus, the doctrine
will have to evolve if Title VII is to address discriminatory machine
learning.</p>
<p>Another issue that’s specific to automated decision making arises
from the fact that the software is usually not developed in-house by the
decision maker but rather by specialized external firms. For example,
companies such as Hirevue and Pymetrics offer tools to automate part of
the hiring process and Upstart provides a predictive model for loan
underwriting. In such cases, who should bear liability? In employment
law, employers, not vendors, bear legal liability.<span class="citation"
data-cites="raghavan2020mitigating"><span><label for="sn-71" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-71" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Raghavan

and Practices,”</span> in <em>Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on
Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency</em>, 2020,
469–81.</span></span></span> But employers (and other clients of these
tools) resist this since they usually lack the expertise to conduct
statistical validation. Shifting some or all of the liability from
clients to vendors would have pros and cons from an anti-discrimination
perspective. It might mean that vendors become much more careful at
testing their offerings. On the other hand, even if a tool has been
broadly tested for disparate impact, it may perform differently in the
context of a particular employer’s applicant pool. Further, plaintiffs
may face even more difficulty in showing an alternative employment
practice.</p>
<p>While disparate treatment and disparate impact are the two main
prongs of anti-discrimination law, when it comes to data-driven
decisions the anti-discrimination toolbox is wider and includes privacy
law, explanation, and potentially consumer protection law. We discuss
these in turn.</p>
</section>
<section id="privacy" class="level2">
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>When we worry about privacy, the underlying concern is often that
data about us could be used to discriminate or might result in adverse
treatment. For example, if a job interviewer inquired about religion, it
may be considered a privacy violation. The harm that animates this worry
is the denial of a job. As another example, reports that the retailer
Target uses shopping records to identify pregnant customers sparked
outrage.<span class="citation"
data-cites="DuhiggHabit"><span><label for="sn-72" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-72" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Duhigg,
<em><span class="nocase">The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in
Life and Business Paperback</span></em> (New York, NY: Random House,
2014).</span></span></span> The potential for harm arises because
pregnancy is a time when individuals are particularly susceptible to
manipulation through marketing (which is the reason that marketers are
interested in pregnancy in the first place).</p>
<p>Yet, data privacy law and anti-discrimination law have largely been
separate in the United States. Returning to the above example, it is not
privacy law that forbids interviewers from asking about religion.
Rather, since employment law forbids discriminating on the basis of
religion, interpretive guidance from the EEOC and, often, from
institutions themselves discourages such questions during
interviews.<span><label for="sn-73" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-73" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">An
early attempt to mingle privacy and accountability (but not
antidiscrimination) goals is seen in t he Fair Information Practice
Principles. The FIPPS contain the seeds of comprehensive data protection
laws enacted around the world. In the U.S., they do not have the force
of law, except in some sectoral laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting
Act. A watered-down version of FIPPS focusing on “notice and choice”
governs U.S. online commerce. <span class="citation"
data-cites="FTCPrivacyReport"> (Landesberg et al., <span>“<span
class="nocase">Privacy Online: A Report to Congress</span>”</span>

role="doc-biblioref">https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/privacy-online-report-congress/priv-23a.pdf</a>)</span></span></span></p>
<p>Still, given the normative alignment, it is natural to wonder whether
privacy law can be adapted to serve antidiscrimination ends. There is a
lot of intuitive appeal to this idea, especially when it comes to
machine learning. If a decision making system relies on data, why not
put restrictions on the flow of data to prevent unjustified
discrimination?</p>
<p>But when we examine this argument in more detail, difficulties
emerge. The most obvious is the issue of proxies. As we discussed in
Chapter 3 , prohibiting access to sensitive attributes such as race or
gender typically has a negligible impact on a classifier when rich
datasets are available. It isn’t just that the decision maker may train
a model to predict the sensitive attribute from innocuous attributes, as
in the Target example above. It may instead directly use the innocuous
attributes to predict the outcome of interest, such as the
susceptibility of a particular person to a particular marketing message.
This is in fact exactly what has been shown to happen on Facebook-scale
advertising platforms.<span class="citation"

Delivery Can Lead to Biased Outcomes,”</span> <em>Proceedings of the ACM
on Human-Computer Interaction</em> 3, no. CSCW (2019):
199.</span></span></span></p>
<p>If proxies are the problem, another approach is to prohibit the
collection of proxies. This is the idea behind “ban the box” laws in
U.S. states that prohibit employers from inquiring about criminal
history. Ban-the-box has two motives. One is to make it easier for
formerly incarcerated people to be rehabilitated into society through
employment. In this view, criminal history itself can be seen as the
sensitive attribute. The other motive is to combat the racially
disparate impact of discrimination against fomerly incarcerated people.
Here, criminal history can be seen as a proxy for race. It is this view
that is of interest to us.</p>
<p>An influential study by Agan and Starr found that employers increased
racial discrimination when they were subject to ban-the-box laws.<span
class="citation"
data-cites="10.1093/qje/qjx028"><span><label for="sn-75" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-75" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Agan

role="doc-biblioref">https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjx028</a>.</span></span></span>
What does this mean for the prospect of preventing discrimination by
prohibiting information flows? One view is that in the light of this
finding, ban-the-box laws clearly harm more than they help. But another
perspective is that racial discrimination is already unlawful, so what
the study really reveals is the need to step up auditing and
enforcement. If that were to happen, ban-the-box laws might be able to
achieve their intended effects.</p>
<p>Going beyond protected attributes and their proxies, privacy law may
make it harder to amass dossiers on individuals (for example, containing
shopping or browsing records), and we might hope that this would make
discrimination harder. While a full discussion of this is beyond our
scope, U.S. privacy law is often criticized for failing to accomplish
this effectively, for several reasons. There is no general federal
privacy law analogous to the GDPR in the E.U. Only a few sectoral
privacy laws exist, such as the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA). Privacy in most commercial transactions or
interactions comes down to “notice and choice”, which is ineffective for
many reasons including the power asymmetry and information asymmetry
between firms and individuals. In the machine learning context, the
notice and choice approach to privacy is particularly ineffective as a
barrier to firms building models that may infer sensitive attributes or
make adverse decisions based on innocuous attributes. That’s because of
the “tyranny of the minority”: it takes only a small number of
individuals to consent to collection to be able to uncover the
statistical patterns that make such inferences possible.<span

<p>While privacy laws have not so far helped to address discrimination,

interpretation.<span class="citation"

Genetic information is an exception to the ubiquity of proxies, as it
cannot readily be inferred with any degree of completeness or accuracy
from observable characteristics.</p>
<p>Broader senses of the word privacy go beyond information flow and
encompass transparency, explanation, and redress. We turn to those
next.</p>
</section>
<section id="explanation" class="level2">
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>In the context of automated decision making, explanation could have
one of two goals. The first is an explanation of the overall system. In
a rule-based system this might be the set of decision rules. In a
machine learning system it’s less obvious what form this explanation
should take, and it is a subject of active research in the field of
interpretable machine learning.</p>
<p>An explanation of the overall system promotes fairness objectives
because it allows regulators, users, and developers to check whether the
system adheres to normative requirements. In many cases, explanation
allows us to immediately spot potential unfairness. For example, if we
know that a system used for detecting fake accounts on social media
relies on an uncommon name as a signal of inauthenticity, it is easy to
see why it may be more likely to incorrectly flag users who are from
minority cultures, as we discussed in Chapter 1.</p>
<p>The second goal of explanation of how a particular decision was made
given the characteristics of the decision subject. This goal can also
promote fairness objectives. It satisfies a powerful innate need to
understand how consequential decisions about us are made. The dread that
arises when a decision system denies us such explanation is visceral
enough that it has a name: Kafkaesque. Explanation of individual
decisions also serves more instrumental purposes. It allows us to
contest decisions that may have been made on the basis of erroneous
information. Even if the decision was accurate, explanation allows
recourse, that is, actions that decision subjects might take to alter
the decision in the future. For example, a loan applicant who was denied
because of a low credit score may make attempts to improve that
score.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, decision systems can be analyzed at three levels.
The highest level is that of values, goals, and normative constraints
(for example, maximizing predictive accuracy while ensuring fairness).
The second is the design of the system and its rules. The third is the
level of individual decisions. In traditional decision making systems,
rulemaking or policymaking is the process of going from the first level
to the second—designing a decision system based on values and goals.
Often, tensions between different values or between different
stakeholders’ objectives become apparent in this process. In
administrative bureaucracies, they are resolved through a process of
public participation.<span class="citation"

The two goals of explanation might help mitigate these concerns: by
allowing us to understand how the overall system and policy conform to
normative constraints and how individual decisions conform to the
policy. These roughly correspond to the distinction between “global” and
“local” interpretability in the technical literature.</p>
<p>Requirements for both flavors of explanation can be seen in existing
laws. The FCRA and ECOA contain an “adverse action notice” requirement.
This is an example of the second goal, as it pertains only to the
individual decision and does not require transparency about the overall
model. In contrast, the GDPR requires “meaningful information about the
logic involved” if an individual is subject to a consequential decision
by an automated system. This is generally understood as requiring some
degree of explanation of both the overall model and the specific
decision.</p>

<p><strong>Table: Comparison of the two flavors of model
explanation</strong></p>
<p>Selbst and Barocas describe several limitations to the usefulness of
explanations. We highlight two main ones. The first is the difficulty of
producing explanations that are simultaneously faithful to the model and
understandable to a nonexpert. If a credit model combines dozens of
variables in nonlinear ways, a reason such as “length of employment” or
“insufficient income” might fall far short of fully explaining a
decision; yet this is all that is required of adverse action notices.
Conversely, an explanation of a decision that is fully faithful to a
statistical model may be incomprehensible to most decision subjects.</p>
<p>There is an important distinction between explanations given
willingly and those demanded by law of a decision maker who has no other
incentive to provide them. So far, it has proven challenging for
regulators to set legal requirements for what constitutes a good
explanation and assess whether they are working as intended. Empirical
evidence supports the difficulty of compelling unwilling decision makers
to provide meaningful explanations. For example, a 2018 study found that
Facebook’s “Why am I seeing this?” explanations are vague, incomplete,
misleading, and generally useless.<span class="citation"
data-cites="AndreouTransparency"><span><label for="sn-82" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-82" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Andreou
et al., <span>“<span class="nocase">Investigating Ad Transparency

System Security Symposium</em>, 2018.</span></span></span></p>
<p>A more fundamental limitation described by Selbst and Barocas is that
even explanations that are faithful and understandable may not enable
normative assessment. If an employer uses a screening model that
computes a score based on some keywords (a faithful and understandable
explanation), it is normatively important to know whether those keywords
represent job-related skills, or act as proxies (for example, hobbies)
that signal social class, or something else. We may be able to make such
an assessment given the keywords, but it is not straightforward. Modern
methods that provide explanations based on high-level concepts rather
than low-level features hold promise in this regard, but the gap between
explanations and a full normative justification is likely to remain.</p>
<p>Because of these limitations, there has been a gradual turn from
explanations to <em>algorithmic impact assessments</em> (AIAs). A full
discussion of AIAs is beyond our scope, but we point out how AIAs, at
least in an idealized version, differ from explanations. First, AIAs go
beyond explaining the model itself and focus on how it was created, how
it will be used, and what impacts it is likely to have. Second, the
primary consumers of AIAs are not decision subjects but rather
regulators and other experts, which alleviates the
faithfulness-comprehensibility tradeoff to some degree. Third, AIAs must
be performed before the model is deployed and must be updated
periodically. Some visions of AIAs call for the involvement of impartial
external parties in producing them.</p>
<p>The GDPR incorporates one version of AIAs, namely Data Protection
Impact Assessments (DPIAs). DPIAs must include a description of the
algorithm, and the purpose of the processing, an assessment of the
necessity of processing in relation to the purpose, an assessment of the
risks to individual rights and freedoms, and the measures a company will
use to address these risks. It requires consultation “where appropriate”
with impacted individuals. But DPIAs are not required to be released to
the public. It is too early to tell how effective they will be in
practice; much will rely on the behavior of regulators.<span

<p>Algorithmic Impact Assessments are closely related to audits and the
terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Nonetheless, there are several
types that are worth distinguishing. A 2020 report classifies them into
four categories:<span class="citation"

<ul>
<li><em>Bias audits</em> conducted by researchers, journalists, or civil
society organizations (inspired by social science audits, as we saw in
the chapter on testing discrimination in practice).</li>
<li><em>Regulatory audits</em> conducted by regulators with statutory
powers to examine internal data and systems, modeled on financial
audits.</li>
<li><em>Algorithmic risk assessments</em> conducted by the developer or
procurer of a tool, modeled on environmental impact assessments, to
assess possible risks and mitigation strategies before deploying a
system.</li>
<li><em>Algorithmic impact evaluations</em>, which are retrospective and
modeled on policy evaluations, conducted typically by public sector
agencies w.r.t. algorithms which implement a policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Algorithmic impact assessments and audits are a burgeoning area<span

potential is still being explored. For example, Ifeoma Ajunwa
ambitiously argues for reading in existing employment law a duty of care
that would obligate employers to conduct audits of automated hiring
systems<span class="citation"

illustrate our point that the turn to machine learning, while indeed
creating challenges for antidiscrimination law, also creates
opportunities alongside it. The software tool and data records involved
in automated systems provide a leverage point for regulators.</p>

<section id="consumer-protection" class="level2">
<h2>Consumer protection</h2>
<p>Consumer protection law has completely different roots from either
antidiscrimination law or privacy law. Consumer movements first gained
ground in the United States in the early 20th century, initially due to
food safety issues.<span class="citation"
data-cites="SinclairJungle"><span><label for="sn-87" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-87" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Sinclair,
<em><span>The Jungle</span></em> (New York, NY: Penguin,
2006).</span></span></span> The Federal Trade Commission was established
in 1914. Although it initially focused on antitrust, consumer protection
gradually became an equally important prong of its activities. It has
been the primary agency responsible for consumer protection, and has the
statutory authority to challenge “unfair or deceptive” practices in
commerce. It is this authority that the agency uses to carry out the
activities that it is well known for, such as policing false advertising
and fraud, especially identity theft.<span class="citation"
data-cites="HoofnagleFTC"><span><label for="sn-88" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-88" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Hoofnagle,
<em><span class="nocase">Federal Trade Commission Privacy Law and
Policy</span></em> (New York, NY: Cambridge University Press,
2016).</span></span></span> Many states have consumer protection laws
with similar import, enforced by attorneys general.</p>
<p>Credit regulation is one area of consumer protection law that also
serves fairness purposes, understood in a broad sense. The Fair Credit
Reporting Act of 1974 narrows the permissible uses of credit reports so
that they are not used for arbitrary purposes. It gives consumers ways
to contest inaccuracies in the data, considering that they are used to
make consequential decisions. And it requires notifying the consumer
when adverse action is taken against them. FCRA does not address
discrimination in the sense of disparate treatment or disparate impact;
that would come later, in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1976. In
other areas such as employment law, consumer protection does not
currently play a role, although scholars have speculatively advocated
for treating job candidates as consumers.<span class="citation"
data-cites="AjunwaParadox"><span><label for="sn-89" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-89" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Ajunwa,
<span>“<span class="nocase">The Paradox of Automation as Anti-Bias
Intervention</span>.”</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Outside the traditional sectors of antidiscrimination law, there is a
vast swath of everyday digital products in which machine learning biases
manifest, and this is where consumer protection law is potentially
highly relevant. For example, if a face unlock feature on a smartphone
is substantially less accurate for some groups of users, this is not a
violation of any of the sector-specific statutes we’ve discussed so far,
but it may fall under FTC authority. Even in domains such as employment
discrimination, there are peculiar gaps such as the fact that vendors of
algorithmic screening tools are not covered entities, and consumer
protection law can potentially help fill this gap.</p>
<p>As of this writing, this is all speculative. So far, the FTC hasn’t
gone after discriminatory practices except when the company also
violates an anti-discrimination statute such as ECOA, which the FTC has
authority to enforce [cite Bronx Honda]. The term “unfairness” in the
FTC act has traditionally meant something quite different: taking
unjustified advantage of consumers that they cannot avoid. The
prototypical example of an unfair commercial practice would be selling
snake oil, and a more modern example would be lax data security leading
to a data breach. But note that unlike the anti-discrimination statutes,
the FTC has substantially more power to determine what constitutes
deceptive and unfair. It is quite possible that the agency will take a
broad view of unfairness and that the courts will permit it. The statute
allows the FTC to look to “established public policies” in determining
what is unfair. It has been suggested that the FTC can thus look to
antidiscrimination statutes and rules as scaffolding to build a
framework for making determinations about algorithmic
discrimination.<span class="citation"

<p>The FTC’s deception authority offers a clearer but more circumscribed
option. Companies often make affirmative claims about their products
being unbiased. If those claims turn out to be false, that’s deception.
The same goes for false claims about products being <em>effective</em>.
This is relevant since many predictive decision making tools on the
market lack evidence of predictive validity, which means that they may
subject people to arbitrary decisions. Yet, unless those arbitrary
decisions are also systematically biased, they are difficult to
challenge under antidiscrimination law. Finally, a lack of transparency
may also constitute a deceptive practice. Indeed, the FTC took action
against a company that trained a face recognition model on its users’
photos while falsely telling them that the feature was
opt-in.<span><label for="sn-91" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-91" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Decision

broadly it treats its authority and how much it flexes its muscles.

and was further caught off guard in the technology era due to
limitations of in-house technical expertise. This led to withering
criticism for failures such as allowing Cambridge Analytica’s
exfiltration of Facebook users’ data, despite the FTC long being aware
of similar previous events and supposedly closely monitoring Facebook
under a “consent decree”. In the 2020s, the agency has shown some signs
of being invigorated. Specifically on algorithmic discrimination, it
published a blog post containing surprisingly strong language.<span

is to say: the relevance of consumer protection law to algorithmic

to act in the best interests of people exposing their data and online
experiences. The duty of loyalty is a common obligation in fiduciary
relationships (for example, a lawyer owes such a duty to her client).
But its application to the holders of personal data is a relatively new
idea. Although it has been proposed mainly with the aim of improving
privacy and minimizing manipulative practices such as “dark patterns”,
it would have some implications for nondiscrimination as well.</p>

<section id="concluding-thoughts" class="level1">
<h1>Concluding thoughts</h1>
<p>We’ve covered a lot of ground in this chapter. We reviewed how the
various civil rights movements together gave rise to a relatively robust
body of anti-discrimination law in the U.S. Generally, this law aims to
strike a balance between preventing (and remedying) discrimination on
the other hand, and avoiding excessive burdens on decision makers on the
other hand. It has been refined, contested, and implemented over decades
by the push and pull of court decisions, regulatory agencies,
institutional bureaucrats, continued civil rights activism, and shifts
in public opinion. It has important limitations: practically, private
plaintiffs find it difficult to find legal recourse; more fundamentally,
the law itself is far from an ideal route to bring about structural
changes.</p>
<p>Turning to the novel challenges raised by automated decision making,
there is a risk that discriminatory machine learning might slip through
the gaps in how the law conceives of discrimination. In our view, this
risk is counterbalanced by the expanded legal toolkit available: privacy
law, requirements regarding explanation and impact assessment, and
consumer protection law. So far, this potential has lain mostly dormant
for various reasons: a narrow conception of privacy, a lack of broad
legislation in the U.S. requiring explanation of consequential
decisions, and the timidity of consumer protection agencies. This could
yet change; it is possible that the law and enforcement agencies could
be reformed to effectively address the new problems. At a minimum, even
if not enshrined into law, the tools for intervention that we’ve
discussed offer a blueprint for public interest advocates seeking to
hold companies accountable.</p>
